# Codex Prompt â€” Book Review Tracker: Next Actions

The scaffold now includes a React + Vite frontend, Express backend, IndexedDB data layer, OpenLibrary search + cover integration, inline review-on-save workflow with unread library tracking, export helpers, and optional Discord webhook posting. Use this prompt when you want the assistant to extend the project.

## Suggested Follow-Up Tasks

1. Harden the IndexedDB wrapper with migrations, per-user review history, and error handling.
2. Flesh out `/api/scan` to parse ISBNs and query a public catalogue (OpenLibrary integration already exists client-side).
3. Integrate a real spellcheck library (nspell or typo-js) behind the current helper.
4. Add CI scripts plus lint/test commands in the frontend and backend `package.json` files.
5. Prototype collaborative Discord features: emoji-vote averages, shared leaderboards, and opt-out/clear-vote flows.
6. Implement import flows and alternative export formats (CSV, Markdown summaries).
7. Extend the OpenLibrary availability prototype into a full borrow/download workflow with account linking and offline reader handoffs.

8. Promote the Discord webhook into a full bot (store message IDs, sync reactions, and update embeds live).
9. Finish the Discord sharing controls (full vs summary toggle) with richer reaction UX and secure opt-in per review.
10. Flesh out the new library tools placeholders with real flows (imports, stats dashboards, device sync) and align the Discord panel polish with final UX.
11. Add comprehensive OpenLibrary search testing: verify search results, cover fetching, availability data, and error handling with various ISBNs and titles.
12. Improve star rating UX with visual feedback (hover states, click zones, accessibility labels).
Provide one task (or a small batch) per run so the assistant can focus on it completely.
